setup-mysql-backups
=========

This Ansible role copies a bash script to the machine that uses mysqldump to backup one or more databases on a nightly cron job. It keeps the latest backup in a folder called `/backups/mysql/current` so that a nightly offsite backup copy/include that file into a backup system. It then moves non-current DB backups into the `/backups/mysql` folder and retains backups up to the number specified by the `setup_mysql_backups_num_db_backups_to_keep` variable (default of 30 backups to keep).

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

	- hosts: your_server
	  vars_files:
	    - vars/main.yml
	  roles:
	    - { role: stancel.setup-mysql-backups }


or 


	- hosts: your_server 
	  vars:
		setup_mysql_backups_num_db_backups_to_keep: 30
		setup_mysql_backups_mysql_root_password: "some password here"
		setup_mysql_backups_dbs_to_backup: 
          - 'db1'
          - 'db2'
	  roles:
